This project is my first portfolio page after learning the basics of web development, with the goal of displaying my skills and projects.

-This project uses HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Bootstrap5.

-Icons were used from fontawesome.

-The 3D tilt of the skill cards was done with the help of the Javascript library, vanilla-tilt.js.

-To make sure the form works without a backend, a form submission service was used from FormKeep.

Code was written by Vincent Thomason

Muhammid Haris Yousaf assisted by finding a link fix to image display problem after the code was pushed to github.
