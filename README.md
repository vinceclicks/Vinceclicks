My name is Vincent Thomason and I'm a Front End Developer from Lexington Kentucky. I made my first portfolio page with vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript after taking a seriously outdated course on Web Development on Coursera. Since then I've taken many more courses and have learned modern front end and backend development.
